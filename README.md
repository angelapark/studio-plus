# Studio Scope

This app is a WIP prototype for an AR Experience for Universal Studios Theme Parks. Our goal was to allow guests to play games and take selfies with virtual park characters.

This prototype was created over a 24 hour period from March 25-26, 2017 for an internal Comcast NBCUniversal Hackathon. Our implementation includes integration of the Vuforia SDK and base classes for use of camera in iOS.

## Expansion of the Project
Some features we'd like to see added to this project, include:
- Geotracking of characters in the park
- A 3D rendering of the park map, based on the already integrated Vuforia SDK
- Unity-based 3D animations of the characters within the park
- Live Camera Face Recognition using CIDetector to apply masks and filters

## Download and Environment Setup

This app requires Xcode 8.2 or higher and with an iOS Deployment Target of 10.0; because this app uses AVFoundation and requires a device input (camera), it cannot be tested on the simulator.
